# BlockLoan - Future-of-Banking 

## Overview
Traditional mortgage processing is slow (30-60 days), expensive, and heavily reliant on manual paperwork. The collateral valuation process is often subjective, leading to loan rejections. Additionally, fraud risks such as fake titles and document tampering persist. In emerging markets, 70% of borrowers lack access to credit due to outdated banking systems, limiting real estate financing opportunities.

## Solution
This project aims to revolutionize mortgage processing by leveraging technology to:
- **Reduce Processing Time**: Automate and streamline workflows to complete mortgage processing in significantly less time.
- **Enhance Accuracy**: Implement AI-based valuation models to ensure fair and unbiased collateral assessment.
- **Mitigate Fraud Risks**: Utilize blockchain and advanced document verification to prevent fraud.
- **Improve Accessibility**: Enable financial institutions to extend mortgage financing to underserved borrowers in emerging markets.

## Features
- **Automated Document Processing**: Digitizes and verifies mortgage documents to reduce manual intervention.
- **Tokenized Property Valuation**: Ensures accurate, tamper-proof collateral assessment through blockchain.
- **Blockchain-Backed Title Verification**: Ensures authenticity and prevents document tampering.
- **Seamless Integration**: API-ready platform that integrates with banking systems and financial institutions.
